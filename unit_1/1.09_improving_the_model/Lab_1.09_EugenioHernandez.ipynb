    "Remember the previous rounds. Follow the steps as shown in previous lectures and try to improve the accuracy of the model. Include both categorical columns in the exercise.\n",
    "Some approaches you can try in this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the concept of multicollinearity and remove insignificant variables\n",
    "- use a different method of scaling the numerical variables\n",
    "- use a different ratio of train test split\n",
    "- use the transformation on numerical columns which align it more towards a normal distribution\n",
